# NativeBase VS Code Extensions README

## Introduction

NativeBase VS Code Extensions are specifically designed to quicken your development process using [NativeBase 3.0](https://alpha.nativebase.io/?utm_source=RnD&utm_medium=Snippet_README&utm_campaign=NativeBase_3).

## Snippets

NativeBase snippets are shorthand for commonly used NativeBase components. All snippets start with the prefix `nb-` and are followed by the name of the desired component. It's that simple.

## How Snippets Work

This extension provides working snippets that make it easy to navigate between different breakpoints by using tabs. Here's a quick look at snippets in action:
